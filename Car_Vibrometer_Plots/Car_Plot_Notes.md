### Description
- Mika's vibrometer data was run through my coding program and plots were created for multiple measurement cases:
  - Case 1: Car off
  - Case 2: Car on
  - Case 3: Car on, music playing
  - Case 4: Revving car engine
 
### Notes
- Measurements of the surfce of the car were taken head-on and from the side
  - I am not sure which data files correspond to head-on measurements and which files correspond to measurements from the side (waiting to hear back from Mika)
