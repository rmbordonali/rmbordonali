### Project Description
This project builds on Project 1 with a focus on passive seismics. In particular, this project was created using data downloaded from TROMINO GRILLA software.
### Code Summary
- Linearly detrending data
- Normalizing data
- Shifting data to zero mean
- Subsampling data
- Tapering data with Hann window
- Fast Fourier transform (FFT) spectra
  - Combining horizontal (north-south and east-west) FFT magnitudes
- Horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (HVSR)
- Short time Fourier transform (STFT) spectrograms with a 20s moving window
