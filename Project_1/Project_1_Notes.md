### Project Description
This project uses Python to create various plots for the purpose of analyzing time series data. For example, daily mean water level data for Toronto (1960-2024) was used when creating this project, as well as drone audio data.

### Code Summary
- Linearly detrending data
- Normalizing data
- Shifting data to zero mean
- Subsampling data
- Tapering data with Hann window
- Adding sine waves to data
- Fast Fourier transform spectra
- Continuous wavelet transform scalograms with Morlet wavelet
- Histograms and statistics for plots
- Interactive Plotly plots
